This project aims to display connections between soccer players in the database found at [this link](https://www.footballsquads.co.uk/archive.htm) using two different graph algorithms which can be compared to one another.
The link in 'link.txt' must be used to download the csv file where data is stored. This should be saved to the same directory as main.cpp in order to run smoothly.
